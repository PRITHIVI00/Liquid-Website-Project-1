                <p>Earlier this year, we launched Liquid+, a place where Team Liquid fans come together, with the intention of giving back to our fans and connecting with them. From campaigns to Experiences, Team Liquid has seen an incredible amount of content come out of our communities</p>
                <p>As we see 2021 come to a close, we want to take a moment to highlight some of our biggest community members here, on teamliquid.com—some of our superfans who have stayed with us through everything. Each one of them has a unique story, their own path to fandom—and we want to share those stories right here for the Liquid+ December Community Spotlight.</p>
                <p>Each one of our fans were chosen for passion and their dedication to supporting Team Liquid through everything, from the highest highs to the lowest lows. Some of them show their love through numerous tweets, while others go above and beyond to create something that brings the community closer. Some of them are consistently on the hunt for Liquid+ points—not for the points themselves, but to demonstrate their appreciation for Team Liquid and its positive impact on their own lives.</p>
